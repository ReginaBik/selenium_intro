** Setting up utilities in Java system and launching a browser:
1. System.setProperty("driverType",  "driverPath"); // this line sets the utilities to Java system
2. WebdDriver utilities = new ChromeDriver();  // this line creates and instance of the utilities

** Maximize browser:
utilities.manage().window().maximize(); // this line maximizes the current window if it is not already maximized
utilities.manage().window().fullscreen(): // this line fullscreens the current window if it is not already fullscreen

** Title validation & URL validation:
utilities.getTitle(); // this line returns the title of the current page as a String; returns null if title is not set for the page
utilities.getCurrentUrl(); // this line returns the URL of the current page as a String

** Selenium Navigation:
utilities.get() is used to navigate to a particular website, but it does not maintain the browser history and cookies. That's why , we cannot use forward, backward or refresh functions
utilities.navigate().to() is also used to navigate to a particular website , but it maintains the browser history and cookies. So, we can use forward, backward and refresh functions to navigate between the web pages

utilities.get("applicationURL"); // this line will navigate us to specified web application
utilities.navigate().to(); // this line is used to navigate a particular page
utilities.navigate().back(); // this line is used to navigate back to previous page
utilities.navigate().forward(); // this line is used to navigate forward to previously visited page
utilities.navigate().refresh(); // this line is used to refresh the current page

** Quit utilities:
utilities.close(); //this line closes only the current window
utilities.quit(); //this line exits the utilities, closing every associated windows, tabs, pop ups, etc.
